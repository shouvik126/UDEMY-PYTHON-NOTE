    "#### * Object Oriented Programming (OOP)allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes.\n",
    "#### *recall that after defining a string,list,dictionary, or other objects, you were able to call methods off of them with the .method_name() syntex.\n",
    "#### *These methods act as functions that use information about the object, as well as the object itself to return results, or change the current object.\n",
    "#### *For example this includes appending to a list,or counting the occurances of an element in tuple. \n",
    "#### *OOP allows users to create their own objects.\n",
    "#### *The general format is often confusing when first encountered, and its usefulness may not be completely clear at first.\n",
    "#### *In general, OOP allows us to create code that is repeatable and organized."
